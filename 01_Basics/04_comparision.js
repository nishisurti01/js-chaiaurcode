// Type Script won't allow you to compare two different data types 

console.log(null>0) // null converted into number 0 that is why false only works for comparision ( <,<=) !important === and == works different thus 
console.log(null === 0 ) // gives false as null is not converted into number 0

// === strict check data type and value both
